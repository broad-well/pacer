# Pacer

## Mission

Given a task _T_ with start date _D0_, end date _Df_, and _W_ units of work to be done, tell me how many units of work I should have finished on an intermediate date if I were to pace the task in a strictly linear fashion.

Also, package this in a webpage, and store the tasks on the client-side.
